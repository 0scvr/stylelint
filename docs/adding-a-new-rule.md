# Adding a new rule

To make sure we don't overlap efforts:

1. First, look at the [naming rules](naming-rules.md) conventions and familiarise yourself with them.
2. Then, open [an issue](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/issues/new) with the title "New rule: *rule-name*" and let everyone else know when you intend to start on the new rule.
3. Once you have something to show, create a [pull request](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/compare) so we can all review the code.
