# Plugins

Plugins are rules and sets of rules built by the community that support methodologies, toolsets, *non-standard* CSS features, or very specific use cases. Their *package* names are prefixed with "stylelint" and their *rule* names must be prefixed to distinguish them from stylelint's core rules.

## Methodologies

### Selector

- [`stylelint-selector-bem-pattern`](https://github.com/davidtheclark/stylelint-selector-bem-pattern): Specify a BEM pattern for selectors (incorporates [postcss-bem-linter](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-bem-linter)).

## Non-standard syntax

### SCSS

#### Declaration

- [`stylelint-declaration-use-variable`](https://github.com/sh-waqar/stylelint-declaration-use-variable): Specify properties for which a SCSS variable must be used.
