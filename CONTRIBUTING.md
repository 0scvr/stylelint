# Contributing

Any help is welcome and appreciated.

## Ways to contribute

* Adding [new rules](docs/developer-guide.md). Whether it's one of the [few](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22New+rule%22+in%3Atitle+is%3Aopen) that we've still to do, or something that you need and we've not thought about.
* Expanding the [documentation](docs).
* Working on other [open issues](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/issues).

## Communication

We communicate mostly via [issues](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/pulls), but there is also a [gitter room](https://gitter.im/stylelint/stylelint) for chat.

### Conduct

Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and circumstances.

Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
