> Modern CSS linter.

## Features

* _Nearly a hundred rules_ - from stylistic rules, such as checking the spacing around the colon in declarations, to rules that catch subtle coding mistakes, such as invalid hex colors or [overriding shorthand properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties#Tricky_edge_cases).
* _Support for the latest CSS syntax_ - including custom properties, range context for media features, calc() and nesting.
* _Completely unopinionated_ - only enable the rules you want and configure them with options to tailor the linter to your needs.
* _Shareable configs_ - if you don't want to craft your own config you can use a shareable config.
* _Support for plugins_ - it's easy to create your own rules and add them to the linter.
* _Options validator_ - so you can be confident that your config is valid.
